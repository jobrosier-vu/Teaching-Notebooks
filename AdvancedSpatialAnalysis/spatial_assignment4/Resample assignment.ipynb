    "# Resampling a raster\n",
    "Raster data doesn't always have the same spatial resolution. Therefore, resampling might be required. It is a rather basic task in any spatial analysis. The good thing about doing it in Python is that you can easily do it for many different rasters, and also that you can document it and automatically set the reference data (i.e. the raster data you want to use as the default for other rasters).
